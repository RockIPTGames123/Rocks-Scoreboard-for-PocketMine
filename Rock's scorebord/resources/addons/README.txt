The way I have made this (Simmilarly to ScoreHud) it uses addons. 
To save myself some effort this is compatable with JackMD's addons. 
Link to download them: https://github.com/JackMD/ScoreHud-Addons
Drag and drop them into the addons folder.
Thanks to JackMD for making those addons
Also there is no reason to use the basic addon as this comes with those features built in.
The tags that come with it are:
{name}, {real_name}, {display_name}, {online}, {max_online}, {item_name}, {item_id}, {item_meta}, 
{item_count}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {load}, {tps}, {level_name}, {level_folder_name}, {ip}, {ping}, {time}, 
{date}, {world_player_count}.

Again Thanks to JackMD for the idea
